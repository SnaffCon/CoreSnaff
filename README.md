# CoreSnaff

It's like Snaffler, in .NET Core, so it's cross platform, but to make it work I had to rip out all of the AD discovery and Share discovery stuff.

As a result, it only works on local stuff, or stuff you've already mounted, and you have to point it at that stuff using `-i /path/to/your/stuff`.

No support, no updates, no masters.
